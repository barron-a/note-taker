## Description
Note Taker is a Node.js app that allows users to save notes with a title and body text. The front end allows users to create new notes and delete notes that are no longer needed. Once a title and text are entered, a save button will appear. Saved notes are stored in an express.js backend that is deployed to Heroku, and visible in a column on the left hand side of the page.
